# PyPi pyopenxr requirs PyOpenGL 3.1.6 while ChimeraX uses PyOpenGL 3.1.7.
# Also pyopenxr depends of glfw for demo programs that we don't need.
# So don't install the pyopenxr dependencies.
# The pyopenxr setup.cfg says it uses 3.1.6 instead of 3.1.7 because
# of a bug on ubuntu.

# We do not support VR on ubuntu.  I made a pyopenxr ticket about this

# Must update pyopenxr.patch when version number is changed.
pyopenxr==1.0.3301

# PyOpenXR 1.0.3301 requires glfw
glfw
